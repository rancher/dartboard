# Qase k6 CLI

`qase-k6-cli` is a command-line tool that integrates k6 with Qase. It provides functionality to gather test case information from Qase and report k6 test results back to Qase.

It supports two modes of operation for parsing k6 results:

1.  **Summary Mode (default)**: Parses the `summary.json` file generated by k6. This is the recommended mode as it provides a concise overview of checks and thresholds. It also supports attaching the k6 HTML report.
2.  **Granular Mode**: Parses the raw JSON output stream from k6. This mode inspects every `Metric` and `Point` line to determine results. It is more verbose and should be used when the summary output is not available.
    - Not tested and may have trouble with large amounts of metrics.

## Build

You can build the cli using the `make` target from the root of the `dartboard` repository:

```shell
make qase-k6-cli
```

This will produce a `qase-k6-cli` binary inside the `qase-k6-cli/` directory.

## Usage

The tool is configured via environment variables and command-line flags and has two subcommands: `report` and `gather`.

### Report

Parses k6 metrics/summary and reports the result to Qase.

```shell
# Example for Summary Mode
export QASE_TESTOPS_API_TOKEN=TOKEN
export QASE_TESTOPS_PROJECT=PRJ
export QASE_TESTOPS_RUN_ID=42
export QASE_TEST_RUN_NAME="My test run"
export QASE_TEST_CASE_NAME="My test case"
export K6_SUMMARY_JSON_FILE="/path/to/summary.json"
export K6_SUMMARY_HTML_FILE="/path/to/report.html" # Optional

./qase-k6-cli report

# Example for Granular Mode
export QASE_TESTOPS_API_TOKEN=TOKEN
export QASE_TESTOPS_PROJECT=PRJ
export QASE_TEST_RUN_NAME="My New Test Run" # Creates a new run
export QASE_TEST_CASE_NAME="My k6 Test"
export K6_OUTPUT_FILE="/path/to/k6-metrics-output.json"
export K6_SUMMARY_HTML_FILE="/path/to/report.html" # Optional

./qase-k6-cli report -granular
```

### Gather

Retrieves test cases from a Qase test run and outputs the 'AutomationTestName' custom field value for each case as JSON.

```shell
export QASE_TESTOPS_API_TOKEN=TOKEN
export QASE_TESTOPS_PROJECT=PRJ

./qase-k6-cli gather -runID 42
```

| Flag        | Description                                                                                                                                      | Default |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------- |
| `-granular` | Enables granular reporting of the raw k6 JSON output stream (`K6_OUTPUT_FILE`). If not set, the tool uses Summary Mode (`K6_SUMMARY_JSON_FILE`). | `false` |
| `-runID`    | Overrides the Qase **Test Run ID** (`QASE_TESTOPS_RUN_ID`).                                                                                      | `""`    |

## How it works

1.  **Initialize Qase Client**: It sets up the Qase client using the `QASE_TESTOPS_API_TOKEN`.
2.  **Determine Test Run**:
    *   It uses the `QASE_TESTOPS_RUN_ID` if provided.
    *   If not, it creates a new test run in the specified `QASE_TESTOPS_PROJECT` with the name from `QASE_TEST_RUN_NAME`.
3.  **Find Test Case**: It fetches the ID of the test case using the title provided in `QASE_TEST_CASE_NAME`.
4.  **Validate Test Case Parameters**:
    *   If the fetched Qase test case has parameters defined, the reporter validates that an environment variable exists for each parameter title.
    *   It supports both "single" and "group" parameter types in Qase.
    *   If any parameter's corresponding environment variable is not set, the reporter will exit with a fatal error.
    *   The collected key-value pairs are sent with the test result to Qase.
4.  **Parse k6 Results**:
    *   In **Summary Mode**, it reads `K6_SUMMARY_JSON_FILE` to extract the status of all checks and thresholds.
    *   In **Granular Mode**, it reads `K6_OUTPUT_FILE` line by line, parsing `Metric` and `Point` objects to determine the status of checks and thresholds.
5.  **Build Qase Comment**: It constructs a Markdown-formatted comment with tables summarizing the results of k6 thresholds and checks.
6.  **Report to Qase**:
    *   It determines an overall status (`passed` or `failed`) based on the parsed results.
    *   It creates a new test result for the specified test case within the test run.
    *   The result includes the status, the Markdown comment, and (in Summary Mode) attaches the HTML report if available.
