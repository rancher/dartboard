# k6 Qase Reporter

`qasereporter-k6` is a command-line tool that parses the output of a k6 test run and reports the results to a Qase test run.

It supports two modes of operation for parsing k6 results:

1.  **Summary Mode (default)**: Parses the `summary.json` file generated by k6. This is the recommended mode as it provides a concise overview of checks and thresholds. It also supports attaching the k6 HTML report.
2.  **Granular Mode**: Parses the raw JSON output stream from k6. This mode inspects every `Metric` and `Point` line to determine results. It is more verbose and should be used when the summary output is not available.
    - Not tested and may have trouble with large amounts of metrics.

## Build

You can build the reporter using the `make` target from the root of the `dartboard` repository:

```shell
make qasereporter-k6
```

This will produce a `qasereporter-k6` binary inside the `qasereporter-k6/` directory.

## Usage

The reporter is configured via environment variables and command-line flags.

```shell
# Example for Summary Mode
export QASE_TESTOPS_PROJECT=PRJ
export QASE_TESTOPS_RUN_ID=42
export QASE_TEST_RUN_NAME="My test run"
export QASE_TEST_CASE_NAME="My test case"
export K6_SUMMARY_JSON_FILE="/path/to/summary.json"
export K6_SUMMARY_HTML_FILE="/path/to/report.html" # Optional

./qasereporter-k6

# Example for Granular Mode
export QASE_TESTOPS_PROJECT=PRJ
export QASE_TEST_RUN_NAME="My New Test Run" # Creates a new run
export QASE_TEST_CASE_NAME="My k6 Test"
export K6_OUTPUT_FILE="/path/to/k6-metrics-output.json"
export K6_SUMMARY_HTML_FILE="/path/to/report.html" # Optional

./qasereporter-k6 -granular
```

| `QASE_TEST_RUN_NAME`     | If `QASE_TESTOPS_RUN_ID` is not provided, a new test run will be created with this name.                  | If `QASE_TESTOPS_RUN_ID` not set |
| `K6_SUMMARY_JSON_FILE`   | Path to the k6 summary JSON file. (Used in **Summary Mode**).                                             | For Summary Mode                 |

| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------- |
| `-granular` | Enables granular reporting of the raw k6 JSON output stream (`K6_OUTPUT_FILE`). If not set, the tool uses Summary Mode (`K6_SUMMARY_JSON_FILE`). | `false` |
| `-runID`    | Overrides the Qase **Test Run ID** (`QASE_TESTOPS_RUN_ID`).                                                                                      | `""`    |

## How it works

1.  **Initialize Qase Client**: It sets up the Qase client using the `QASE_TESTOPS_API_TOKEN`.
2.  **Determine Test Run**:
    *   It uses the `QASE_TESTOPS_RUN_ID` if provided.
    *   If not, it creates a new test run in the specified `QASE_TESTOPS_PROJECT` with the name from `QASE_TEST_RUN_NAME`.
3.  **Find Test Case**: It fetches the ID of the test case using the title provided in `QASE_TEST_CASE_NAME`.
4.  **Validate Test Case Parameters**:
    *   If the fetched Qase test case has parameters defined, the reporter validates that an environment variable exists for each parameter title.
    *   It supports both "single" and "group" parameter types in Qase.
    *   If any parameter's corresponding environment variable is not set, the reporter will exit with a fatal error.
    *   The collected key-value pairs are sent with the test result to Qase.
4.  **Parse k6 Results**:
    *   In **Summary Mode**, it reads `K6_SUMMARY_JSON_FILE` to extract the status of all checks and thresholds.
    *   In **Granular Mode**, it reads `K6_OUTPUT_FILE` line by line, parsing `Metric` and `Point` objects to determine the status of checks and thresholds.
5.  **Build Qase Comment**: It constructs a Markdown-formatted comment with tables summarizing the results of k6 thresholds and checks.
6.  **Report to Qase**:
    *   It determines an overall status (`passed` or `failed`) based on the parsed results.
    *   It creates a new test result for the specified test case within the test run.
    *   The result includes the status, the Markdown comment, and (in Summary Mode) attaches the HTML report if available.
